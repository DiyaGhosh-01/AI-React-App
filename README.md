## Introduction

This application aims to simplify the T-shirt design process by providing an intuitive platform where users can easily generate designs using AI prompts.  Forget struggling with complex design software â€“ simply describe your vision, and let the AI bring it to life!  The 3D visualization powered by Three.js allows users to preview their designs on a virtual T-shirt in real-time, providing a realistic representation of the final product.

## Features

* **AI-Powered Design Generation:** Generate T-shirt designs using creative AI prompts.
* **Real-time 3D Visualization:** Preview designs on a 3D model of a T-shirt using Three.js.
* **Customization Options:**  (Potentially implement) Adjust colors, add text, and further refine generated designs.
* **User-Friendly Interface:**  Intuitive and easy-to-use design interface.
* **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):**  Utilizes Express.js for improved SEO and initial load times.
* **Responsive Design:**  Works seamlessly across different devices.

## Technologies Used

* **ReactJS:**  Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Three.js:**  JavaScript library for creating and displaying 3D graphics in a web browser.
* **AI Model/API:** (Specify the AI model or API used for design generation, e.g., OpenAI API, Stable Diffusion API, etc.)
* **Node.js:**  JavaScript runtime environment.
* **npm/yarn:**  Package manager.
